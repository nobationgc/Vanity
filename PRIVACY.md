# Privacy Policy

## Overview

Vanity is a standalone, optional communication tool that operates outside
the Roblox game client.

This document describes how data is handled by the application.

---

## Data Collected

Vanity processes only the following non-personal, platform-level identifiers:
- Roblox userId
- Roblox placeId
- Roblox jobId (server/session identifier)

These identifiers are used solely for contextual display and session
association.

---

## System State Detection

Vanity may perform passive detection of the presence of a Roblox-related
process to determine application state.

This detection:
- Is read-only
- Does not access process memory
- Does not open privileged handles
- Does not transmit process information
- Is not stored or logged

Process state detection is used solely for local runtime logic and does not
constitute data collection.


---

## Public Metadata Resolution

Vanity may perform read-only requests to publicly accessible, unauthenticated
Roblox endpoints to resolve publicly visible metadata, such as:
- Username associated with a userId
- Experience or game name associated with a placeId

No authentication credentials or private endpoints are used.

---

## Data Not Collected

Vanity does NOT collect, store, or process:
- IP addresses
- Device identifiers or hardware information
- Geolocation data
- Biometric data
- Personal identification documents
- Audio, video, or image data
- Roblox authentication tokens, cookies, or session data

No tracking, analytics, profiling, or behavioral monitoring is performed.

---

## Data Storage and Retention

Vanity does not maintain persistent storage of user data.

Any processed identifiers are used transiently for runtime functionality
and are not retained after the application is closed.

---

## Data Sharing

No data is sold, shared, or transferred to third parties.

---

## User Control

Use of Vanity is entirely optional and voluntary.

Users may stop all data processing by closing the application.

---

## Changes

This document may be updated to reflect technical changes to the application.
