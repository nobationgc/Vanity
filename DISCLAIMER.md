# Legal and Technical Disclaimer

## Independent Third-Party Software

This software is an independent, third-party, community-developed application.

It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or associated with
Roblox Corporation, Roblox Studio, or any related entities.

All trademarks and platform names remain the property of their respective owners.

## Operational Scope and Isolation

This software operates entirely outside the Roblox platform, runtime, and
execution environment.

It does NOT:
- Modify the Roblox client, binaries, or configuration files
- Inject code, DLLs, or libraries into any Roblox process
- Hook, patch, scan, or manipulate process memory
- Perform inter-process communication (IPC) with Roblox
- Send signals, threads, or messages to Roblox processes
- Intercept, proxy, inspect, or alter network traffic
- Automate gameplay, user input, or in-game actions
- Access private, internal, or authenticated Roblox APIs
- Alter or influence the behavior of Roblox services

The software remains logically and technically isolated from the Roblox client.

---

## Process State Detection (Passive)

The software may perform passive process state detection to determine
whether a Roblox-related process (e.g., robloxplayerbeta.exe) is currently active.

This detection:
- Is read-only
- Uses standard operating system process enumeration
- Does not open privileged process handles
- Does not read process memory or registers
- Does not attach debuggers
- Does not alter execution state or priority

Process detection is used solely as a conditional flag for local logic flow.

No interaction, control, or manipulation of the detected process occurs.

---

## Local Log File Access

The software may read locally generated log files created by the Roblox client
on the user's own device.

These log files:
- Are generated by Roblox itself
- Are publicly accessible on the local filesystem
- Are read without modification
- Are not transmitted in raw form

No protected, restricted, or system-level resources are accessed.

---

## Identifiers Processed

The software processes only the following platform-level technical identifiers:
- Roblox userId
- Roblox placeId
- Roblox jobId (server or session identifier)

These identifiers:
- Are not real-world identifiers
- Are not linked to personal identity
- Are used exclusively for contextual display and session association

No correlation with personal data is performed.

---

## Public Endpoint Usage

The software may perform read-only requests to publicly accessible,
unauthenticated endpoints provided by Roblox.

These requests are strictly limited to the resolution of publicly visible
metadata, including:
- Username resolution from a userId
- Experience or game name resolution from a placeId

No authentication tokens, session cookies, OAuth credentials, or private
endpoints are used.

All requests are informational in nature and equivalent to data accessible
via standard web access to Roblox services.

---

## Data Explicitly Not Collected

The software does NOT collect, store, transmit, or process:
- IP addresses
- Network identifiers
- Device or hardware fingerprints
- Operating system telemetry
- Geolocation data
- Biometric data
- Personal identification documents
- Audio, video, or image data
- Roblox authentication credentials or session artifacts

No tracking, profiling, analytics, or behavioral inference is performed.

---

## Network Communication Constraints

If network communication is present, it is limited to the transmission of
non-personal technical identifiers required for core functionality.

No personally identifiable information (PII) is transmitted, retained,
shared, or monetized.

---

## User Responsibility and Compliance

Use of this software is entirely optional and voluntary.

Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of this software
complies with applicable laws, platform terms of service, and local regulations.

The developer assumes no responsibility for misuse, modification, or
redistribution by third parties.

---

## No Circumvention or Enforcement Evasion

This software is not designed, intended, or promoted to bypass, evade,
disable, or interfere with moderation systems, safety mechanisms,
age verification processes, or enforcement actions of any platform.

The software provides only out-of-platform communication functionality.

implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability,
