# Vanity

Vanity is an external, optional communication tool designed to operate
outside the platform runtime, providing out-of-platform community
interaction without modifying client behavior or accessing internal systems.

## Overview

Vanity runs independently from the Roblox game client and operates as a
standalone application.

It does not integrate into, modify, or interfere with Roblox processes
or services, and remains logically isolated from the client runtime.

## Operation

Vanity may perform passive detection of the presence of a Roblox-related
process solely to determine local application state.

No interaction, memory access, or process manipulation is performed.

## Distribution

This repository provides precompiled binary releases only.

Each release includes:
- The executable binary
